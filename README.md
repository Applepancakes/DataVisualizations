# Data Visualizations I have worked on using 3 relevant tools in the industry(Excel, Tableau, and PowerBI)


First Visualization is using publicly sourced survery data in PowerBI.
 
We have a sample of 630 submisions, their country of origin, what they do for work, and their opinion on certain matters such as work/life balance.

As we can see, Data analysts make up a fair majority of this sample size. An above average work life balance is good, but many appear to be disappointed with their salary.

 In a different project leveraging Public Tableau resources, we have the performance of a mock bike company visualized over three years

In the year 2018 in Texas, it appears the only store making Revenue was Rowlett Bikes. Luckily we can see that they have been supported by a loyal repeat customer.

The data used to create this dashboard was pulled using a SQL query. With this report, I exported it to Excell.

And leveraged my knowledge of Pivot tables to set up these following visualizations.

The interactive menus are my favorite, allowing for Executives to have more readable information at their fingertips.
